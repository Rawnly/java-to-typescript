# Java to TypeScript
> Just another converter.

## Why?
As a `FullStack` I always need to convert some `java` classes to `TypeScript` interfaces, so that tool should make this easier and faster (and even funnier ðŸš€)

## How
It's all `regex` :v:

## Contribute
You can contribute by improving this big function [here](utils)
